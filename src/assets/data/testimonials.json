During his time at Coding Dojo Howard frequently identified areas of need and acted quickly and decisively to provide solutions. Howard was a pleasure to work with and he will be sorely missed. I am positive that Howard will be an asset to any team. I hope to be able to work with him again in the future."

I've worked with him in the same facility (on different teams) for a total of about nine months now, and during the entire time he never failed to deliver excellent work ethic, compassion for our customers, and genuine joy to our workplace. Our students loved him, and our team felt no different. Howard is collaborative, and an overall team player. I will gladly continue to partner with Howard."
